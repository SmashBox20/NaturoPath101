      "description": "Piper methysticum is a plant native to the South Pacific islands, where it has been used ceremonially and medicinally for over 3,000 years. The root contains kavalactones, compounds with anxiolytic and muscle-relaxant properties. Kava has gained popularity in Western countries as a natural remedy for anxiety, though concerns about potential liver toxicity have led to restrictions in some countries.",
