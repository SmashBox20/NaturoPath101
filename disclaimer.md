### Regulation Status
**Important**: In many countries, including the United States, herbal supplements are not evaluated by regulatory agencies (such as the FDA) in the same way as pharmaceutical drugs. Claims made about herbal products have not been evaluated by the FDA, and these products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
