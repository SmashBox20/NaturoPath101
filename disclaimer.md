NaturoPath: 101 — Important Legal & Medical Disclaimer

NaturoPath: 101 is an educational informational resource about herbal and plant-based remedies and their traditional and investigational uses. It is NOT a healthcare provider and does NOT provide medical diagnoses, medical advice, or treatment plans.

Before using any herbal remedy, especially if you:
- are pregnant or breastfeeding,
- have known allergies,
- have chronic medical conditions (e.g., autoimmune disease, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease),
- are on prescription medication(s),
- or are considering replacing or weaning off prescription medication,

you MUST consult with a qualified healthcare professional (MD, DO, PharmD, or other licensed clinician). Herbal remedies can interact with prescription medications and may cause allergic reactions, adverse events, or interfere with ongoing treatments.

The information in this app is compiled from a variety of sources (traditional texts, scientific literature, pharmacopeias) and is intended for informational purposes only. Evidence levels are noted where available; some uses are traditional and lack rigorous clinical validation. The app's content should not be construed as endorsement of replacing prescription medications without medical supervision.

The Medicine Cabinet premium feature is an informational interaction-checking tool. It provides possible interactions based on known ingredient mappings and curated rules. It does NOT replace professional clinical judgment. Never stop or modify prescription medication without consulting your prescribing clinician.

If you experience any adverse reaction after using any remedy described in this app, stop use immediately and seek medical attention.

By using this app you agree that the developers, contributors, advisors, and distributors are not liable for outcomes resulting from use of the information provided. Always consult a healthcare professional before making changes to your medication or treatment plan.
